This folder (will) contain scripts to generate the TFRecords for MSD tracks on Boden, our server. Each script can be run in terminal by typing `python <script name.py>`, and each script has an `--help` page containing all the information about options and parameters. Each script relies on the output file of the previous one in order to function correctly. Here is an outline of the correct workflow:

 - `python track_fetch.py <options> output.csv` creates an output.csv file containing a list of file paths, the 7Digital ID of the tracks, and some extra information about the audio file (the filenames are supposed to be of the form 7Digital ID + '.clip.mp3');

- `python track_wrangle.py <options> input.csv output.csv` reads an input.csv file (generated by track_fetch.py) and creates an output.csv file which links each track to the track ID contained in the MSD summary file (download [here](http://millionsongdataset.com/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/msd_summary_file.h5)) and removes unwanted entries such as mismatches, duplicates or files which can't be opened;

- `python mp3_to_npz.py <options> input.csv` reads an input.csv file (generated by track_wrangle.py, or by track_fetch.py) and creates the npz files which will allow us to analyse which tracks are silent;

- `python track_wrangle_silence.py <options> input.csv output.csv` reads an input.csv file (generated by track_wrangle.py) and looks for the npz files generated by mp3_to_npz.py to create an output.csv file containing only tracks which satisfy certain requirements, such as a minimal "effective length" or a maximal amount of silence.
