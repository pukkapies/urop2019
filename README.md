# urop2019
Summer UROP 2019 project repository.

## Workflow

Never push directly to the `master` branch!

When working on this repository, create a new branch using the convention *yourname_feature* (with `git checkout -b branchname`). For example, the branch that updated this README.md file is called `kevin_update_readme`.

Whilst working on your branch, keep it up to date with the `master` branch by regularly merging the `master` branch into your branch.

When your work is ready, create a pull request. At least one other team member needs to approve your pull request before it can be merged into `master`.
